# this is how i javascript

This is my Sublime Test 3 package for ES5 + ES6 JavaScript.

It includes:

* language definitions for JS (ES5 and ES6) and JSON
* snippets for JS (ES5 and ES6)


## Install

**I have no idea what I am doing. If you are a sublime text 3 pro, please file an issue on how this should work.**

This assumes you are on OSX.
It will wreck whatever JS package you currently have to be Absolutely Sure That There Is Only One Language Definitionâ„¢ because that was easier than figuring out the right way.

1. clone this repo
2. run `./link.sh`
